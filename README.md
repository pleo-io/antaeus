## Antaeus

Antaeus (/√¶nÀàtiÀê…ôs/), in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaia. He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death.

Welcome to our challenge.

## The challenge

As most "Software as a Service" (SaaS) companies, Pleo needs to charge a subscription fee every month. Our database contains a few invoices for the different markets in which we operate. Your task is to build the logic that will schedule payment of those invoices on the first of the month. While this may seem simple, there is space for some decisions to be taken and you will be expected to justify them.

## Instructions

Fork this repo with your solution. Ideally, we'd like to see your progression through commits, and don't forget to update the README.md to explain your thought process.

Please let us know how long the challenge takes you. We're not looking for how speedy or lengthy you are. It's just really to give us a clearer idea of what you've produced in the time you decided to take. Feel free to go as big or as small as you want.

## Developing

Requirements:
- \>= Java 11 environment

Open the project using your favorite text editor. If you are using IntelliJ, you can open the `build.gradle.kts` file and it is gonna setup the project in the IDE for you.

### Building

```
./gradlew build
```

### Running

There are 2 options for running Anteus. You either need libsqlite3 or docker. Docker is easier but requires some docker knowledge. We do recommend docker though.

*Running Natively*

Native java with sqlite (requires libsqlite3):

If you use homebrew on MacOS `brew install sqlite`.

```
./gradlew run
```

*Running through docker*

Install docker for your platform

```
docker build -t antaeus
docker run antaeus
```

### App Structure
The code given is structured as follows. Feel free however to modify the structure to fit your needs.
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ buildSrc
|  | gradle build scripts and project wide dependency declarations
|  ‚îî src/main/kotlin/utils.kt 
|      Dependencies
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-app
|       main() & initialization
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-core
|       This is probably where you will introduce most of your new code.
|       Pay attention to the PaymentProvider and BillingService class.
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-data
|       Module interfacing with the database. Contains the database 
|       models, mappings and access layer.
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-models
|       Definition of the Internal and API models used throughout the
|       application.
|
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-rest
        Entry point for HTTP REST API. This is where the routes are defined.
```

Happy hacking üòÅ!

### Thoughts
1. I noticed Transaction level - serializable. It can bring a huge performance hit
   as it doesn't allow concurrent transactions on the same data subset
2. Consider this situation in a distributed environment
3. I assume that PaymentProvider will not charge the same invoice twice.

## To improve
1. Implement failover for scheduled job in case something went wrong.
2. For Payment provider errors consider better handling e.g. retry for NetworkException.
CustomerNotFoundException requires further investigation as it can be caused by
wrong/corrupted data. CurrencyMismatchException requires either usage exchange rate service    
or changing invoice creation process.
3. We should consider db pagination in case the amount of invoices will be too high
4. In general if we would have many invoices - we should batch process them. 
5. I would move job scheduler to separate service or serverless instance
6. I would add createInvoice method to InvoiceService because in theory it's
possible to create invoice with the different currency than default for customer.
I'm not sure if application spec contains that.
7. We also need to notify customer about payment using email or another convenient channel
8. For new db calls I would add Integration Tests

## Additional
1. I've chosen krontab framework because it less verbose than alternatives, 
   extensible and fits the needs. Also it has good github community and development is pretty active
