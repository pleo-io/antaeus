## Antaeus

Antaeus (/√¶nÀàtiÀê…ôs/), in Greek mythology, a giant of Libya, the son of the sea god Poseidon and the Earth goddess Gaia. He compelled all strangers who were passing through the country to wrestle with him. Whenever Antaeus touched the Earth (his mother), his strength was renewed, so that even if thrown to the ground, he was invincible. Heracles, in combat with him, discovered the source of his strength and, lifting him up from Earth, crushed him to death.

Welcome to our challenge.

## The challenge

As most "Software as a Service" (SaaS) companies, Pleo needs to charge a subscription fee every month. Our database contains a few invoices for the different markets in which we operate. Your task is to build the logic that will schedule payment of those invoices on the first of the month. While this may seem simple, there is space for some decisions to be taken and you will be expected to justify them.

## Instructions

Fork this repo with your solution. Ideally, we'd like to see your progression through commits, and don't forget to update the README.md to explain your thought process.

Please let us know how long the challenge takes you. We're not looking for how speedy or lengthy you are. It's just really to give us a clearer idea of what you've produced in the time you decided to take. Feel free to go as big or as small as you want.

## Developing

Requirements:
- \>= Java 11 environment

Open the project using your favorite text editor. If you are using IntelliJ, you can open the `build.gradle.kts` file and it is gonna setup the project in the IDE for you.

### Building

```
./gradlew build
```

### Running

There are 2 options for running Anteus. You either need libsqlite3 or docker. Docker is easier but requires some docker knowledge. We do recommend docker though.

*Running Natively*

Native java with sqlite (requires libsqlite3):

If you use homebrew on MacOS `brew install sqlite`.

```
./gradlew run
```

*Running through docker*

Install docker for your platform

```
docker build -t antaeus
docker run antaeus
```

### App Structure
The code given is structured as follows. Feel free however to modify the structure to fit your needs.
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ buildSrc
|  | gradle build scripts and project wide dependency declarations
|  ‚îî src/main/kotlin/utils.kt 
|      Dependencies
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-app
|       main() & initialization
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-core
|       This is probably where you will introduce most of your new code.
|       Pay attention to the PaymentProvider and BillingService class.
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-data
|       Module interfacing with the database. Contains the database 
|       models, mappings and access layer.
|
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-models
|       Definition of the Internal and API models used throughout the
|       application.
|
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ pleo-antaeus-rest
        Entry point for HTTP REST API. This is where the routes are defined.
```

###My Notes

####About the language
I have never worked with Kotlin before, so I had to spend some time to get into it. In general, I liked the language, it looks like the son of Java with Typescript.

####About the task
It took me about 10 hours, and I have divided it into 3 parts:
 
 1. I focussed on the payment feature, for this I have created a new endpoint ```/rest/v1/billing/pending``` to test more quickly if the invoices had been billed correctly. I also added a new Invoice Status, so it is marked as error in case of any invoice payment fails, this way it can be handled later as an isolated case. I also extended the invoiceDAL to fetch certain kind of invoices and to modify its status.  Last but not least, I have added unit tests to the billing service, which are testing mainly the exceptions thrown by the payment provider.
 2. I created a rudimentary scheduler which schedules any passed function to the 1st day of the next month and is executed again after 30 days. I particularly found this part a bit complicated since could not find a good way to make it run specifically every 1st of each month. I have hardcoded 30 days as milliseconds, but I'm aware that this can lead to subsequent erroneous dates since the number of days in a month can vary.  I have also considered bringing in a scheduler library like Quartz, but I have never used it too, so  I decided to start my own, which still has a lot to be improved.
 3. Writing this README.md
 
 Apart from that, I have included some comments with ```Todo:``` in the code, to places where I think it`s suitable to make improvements in the future.
